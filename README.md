# Deep Learning

- TensorflowNN.ipynb: my first Tensorflow fully connected neural network using the MNIST dataset
- WeightInitialization.ipynb: A fully connected neural network using only Numpy and the MNIST dataset as well as an investigation of how different methods for weight initialization affect the training of the network.
